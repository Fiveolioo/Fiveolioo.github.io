Finally, Something that we can see that is being made with our own logic! Creating a CRUD app is by far one of the stressful/rewarding thing I has happened in my days at Flatiron. Honestly though, it really feels good when you can see your masterpiece infront of you own eyes espesically on the browser! This project reminded me like painting, first you have to think what you will create, take sometime and be careful with everything you do and then in the end. Its all so worth it.

What I liked about this compared to our CLI project before is the use of gems that do the work for us. This means fewer logic we have to do and just apply. Using like has_secure_password for me was mind blowing on how it can turn a users password into a scramble hash for us so it can be secure. After I just need to use my built in authenticate method to show that it is actually the users password.

Now the fun part. ERB was my favorite in all this because it pretty much showed everything on the browser what I created. Learning about how < forms > are used was cool to me since it grabbed users data with a Action/Method option to post towards my next controller option via 'post'. Using mostly HTML in this, it finally gave me a feel on what things I can create comfortably.

Though it felt easier in some parts than my CLI project. It was still stressful for me. Bugs were everywhere when I first started since I'd say i kind of rushed into it rather than testing every bit first. Some were solving fast but others took hours sometimes. One was actually finding why my user_ids.include?(user.id) wasnt passing. Turns out user_ids was a string rather than an integer when created in my DB *face palm*. Though something so small like that which took me hours made me realized how being precise and always testing can be important. 

Other things that bothered me were sometimes shotgun, Accidently closing sometimes always irritated me since I always had to find the session its in to 'kill' it. Though, its part of the coding life in my opinion, bugs and screw ups can be everywhere, its always just about staying calm and striving through. Stress can always be your worst enemy in coding as breaking down has been for me in the past with code.

Overall, I am really proud of myself no matter what in this project. I'd say that I learned a lot while creating my project, sometimes more than the lessons itself. I cant wait to see what more things I can build later in the future with flatiron as I will always stay passionate in my coding future.
