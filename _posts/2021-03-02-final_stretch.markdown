Its finally here, my final project for Flatiron. Its honestly been the most tougest one because of inputting everything I learned throughout the course. Though I still feel accomplished on what I have created.

I created pretty much a craigslist app for cars only by using the react/redux and rails. It was honestly a pretty cool module for me since I learned what a lot programmars use on the real world, like using redux/app.js/components etc. I thought maybe I can take the skills what ive learned towards a job search. But like I said before, it was sure a tough one.

I came across many bugs in my code like routing issues, components not rendering, user validation issues etc. but what I noticed with React is that its much more easier to debug! Using things like const composeEnhancer = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose; was great on checking stuff like my state and seeing whats being put in or not. I must say, react is on my top favorite for debugging.

Though, I still feel I have much to learn in the future because of how much a tough time I had. But im glad to say this was a great big baby step for me. Hopefully I can create way better react apps with ease if I come across any job.
