I was always in the tech field after graduating high school, from doing IT in the military, going into college for Computer Science then working as IT specialist in the healthcare industry. That being said, it finally came to that point in 5 years of my career that I thought I could use a change in careers. I still wanted to be in the tech field but something with more interest and challenges. I always thought  about either Systems administration or cyber security but it wasnt until I heard about web developing. My girlfriend is currently a Software Engineer and I usually look over on what she does on the daily, it made me have an interest in coding after that since it was honestly fun trying out coding like on Codeacademy.com. Sure enough I know it will be a new challenging  moment in my life but I am eager to learn as much as I can to be a future Software Engineer.
