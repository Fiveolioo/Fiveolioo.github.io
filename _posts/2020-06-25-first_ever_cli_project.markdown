Ever had those moments when you think it'll be so stressful but in the end, you tell yourself "That wasnt eben that bad!". That's what happend with me during this project. From picking my very own API I wanted to do, to setting up all my code then in the end with refactoring.

It took me a couple of days but I managed to pick something that I like! Which is Star Wars. Luckily I found a great API website that had a list of character from every Star Wars book/movie you can think of. This is when the fun began.

I first pretty much had all my run and environment files set up which was confusing at first but ended up getting that hang of it.

Next was creating my API class. It took me a little back and forth with this since it was confusing for me a little when doing my previous lessons on API, though I eventually got the hang of it with the help of the study groups. It pretty much gets all the characters I want from the nested hashes and digs for the characters details within.

Next came to more easier to understand parts. Creating the Characters Class was pretty much a simple class which intialized all my characters that I chose from and group it in my @@all. I had a list of att_accesors with characters "Name", "Height", "Gender", "Hair Color", "Skin Color", "Eye Color" and "Birth Year". 

Next came to the most logic part of my classes. The CLI Class. This had pretty much everything in it from "Introduction", character details/info, loop, menu and etc. Creating my loop was tough one with which style should I choose from? I ended up using a Case statement with this since its the cleanest one of all I can think of. For my characters details/info, it was just a matter of using my API class for getting all its details.

In the end, it was just all making my CLI look fancy for the user to use(the fun part lol). Also a bit of refactoring on what I can take out while maintaining the interface.

I honestly had fun creating this project because it actually made me feel good creating a whole CLI all by myself, with the help of my instructor of course. Also the best part of it is, it gives a big confidence boost on the days ahead since I can tell my self "It'll probably suck in the beginning, but in the end it will be all worth it".
