I will have to say this was a great fun project to do. Stressful, but fun! From doing a little bit of backend rails, to creating interesting styling with css front end. It was still a different ball game though since the main focus was Javascript. Learning it came fast though since it was honestly identical with ruby, just using different style methods. Ill still love ruby more since it will be my "first" and easier to understand.

Backend was honestly not that bad for me. It was like doing my rails project all over again but creating API's. it was a little tougher at first but it came along real quick with practice. Id say it was a lot time consuming in creating my seed data for the database. But like I said, it wasnt all that new to me thanks to my rails project.

For Frontend, thats where things got interesting. It was pretty cool on making styles with it and building out the single page application through DOM. I guess one of the hard things I noticed was making code clean. Also, figuring out how the signup/login was going to work took some time but seemed to work well after some trial and error.

I found some bugs along the way while testing out the different clicks on the page, and as I came across things like makeing containers disappear when clicking a button, I had to update my code and test from the beginning. Overall, this project was a great way for me to practice DOM and some of the different HTTP methods though!
