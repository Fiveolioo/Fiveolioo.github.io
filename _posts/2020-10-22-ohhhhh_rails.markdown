This project I have to say was the most hardest one till this date. Though as I always say... "It pays to be a winner". Even though after all the stressful days and night including work, I managed to be able to get all of code done. It really made me feel good in the end because of what I accomplished on making/designing. But in the end, I am just happy im done with it, lol.

For me it was very similar to sinatra bought just on steroids, Things are pretty much built out for you, using pre methods made withing rails. This is what I didnt like. It was very hard to memorize sometimes about which method to create or not make because of rails. To me, I like the foundation of building everything by hand ground up since I know what im doing and can easily find it if ever needed to.

What was cool though is the Omniauth, I always wondered how signing in with facebook or google worked and it was the most fascinating of all. I really had fun doing that because it really made me feel like a developer at a point. Confusing at first, but it all worked out great in the end. 

Devise saved me. I learned out about a gem called Devise which pretty much made me do less work with everything I did, like flatiron says "coders are lazy". I know I say that I would rather build things ground up, but this literally blew my mind. Having to use devise made me user my render more easily and views. Throughout the way, I just needed to add in code for my controllers/validations and wala, a whole website to use.

Even though this was my hardest till this date, I just know it will get tougher. But as it gets tougher, it makes me really feel good about myself compared to a unconfident person I was back at First mile. I hope to grow more as a developer all the way till graduation to know I really made a impact in my life.
